# Group Lasso, Ridge Lasso, and Kernel Ridge Regression in R

This repository provides implementations of Group Lasso, Ridge Lasso, and Kernel Ridge Regression in R. These regularization techniques are widely used in machine learning and statistical modeling for variable selection, regularization, and prediction tasks.

## Overview

Regularization techniques like Group Lasso, Ridge Lasso, and Kernel Ridge Regression are used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of predictive models.

- Group Lasso: Group Lasso is an extension of Lasso that encourages sparsity at the group level. It is particularly useful when the features can be naturally grouped together, and we want to select entire groups of features rather than individual ones.

- Ridge Lasso (Elastic Net): Ridge Lasso, also known as Elastic Net, combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties. It balances the advantages of both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a compromise between feature selection and regularization.

- Kernel Ridge Regression: Kernel Ridge Regression is a non-linear extension of Ridge Regression that utilizes kernel functions to map the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. It is capable of modeling complex relationships between the features and the target variable.

## Implementation Details

This repository contains the following R scripts:

- `group lasso.Rmd`: Implements the Group Lasso algorithm using various optimization techniques, such as coordinate descent or proximal gradient descent.
- `ridge, lasso.Rmd`: Provides the implementation of Ridge Lasso (Elastic Net) regression using the glmnet package.
- `kernel_ridge_regression.m`: Implements Kernel Ridge Regression using the kernel functions and linear algebra operations.
